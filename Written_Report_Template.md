# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Provide a high level analysis for a fundraising campaing.
### Purpose
    To determine how different campaigns fared in relation to:
    1. launch dates and, their
    2. funding goals.
    3. Visualize the campaing based on above items.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

1.  It looks like we are dealing with a seasonal product where its peak occurs in May.
2.  "Canceled" status is a condition that its is pretty predictable, the line is almost flat.
3.  December is a month where I wouldn't invest my efforts.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
1.  I shouldn't worry about "Percentage Canceled" status because it the data does not exist or may tend to zero.
2.  Both lines Successful and Failes are inversely porportional, by knowing one of them you may predict the outcome of the other.
3.  "Sucess" mainly comes at the first two range of levels.
4.  "Success" between tanges of 39999 - 49999 can not be explained.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I think that the information provided in class, documents, and assistance of TAs made this challenge bearable.
I am pretty raw doing graph analysis. I know that I am missing more things in translating them.

## Results

- _What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?_

- _What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?_
    1. There is a simetric/mirror relationshihp where the financial break point between %
       failure and %cancel is 50%.
    2. Percentage canceled is not a significant in the analysis.

- _What are some limitations of this dataset?_
    1. Size. In the "Theater Outcomes by Launche Date" I wish I can have data for more than a year.

- _What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?_
    1.  Clustered or Stacked Column (or Bar)
    2.  Combo
